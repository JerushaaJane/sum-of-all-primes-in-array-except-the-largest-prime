To print sum of primes numbers in array except the sum of largest prime number in array

Find Sum of all prime numbers in the array, except the largest prime number:

Madhav has been assigned the task of finding the sum of all prime numbers in a given 
array, except the largest prime number in the array. Madhav approaches you to help him do this 
by writing a program.

Given an array of numbers, you are expected to find the sum of all prime numbers in the given 
array. You must however exclude the largest prime number while performing this addition.

For example
If imput1={10,41,18,50,43,31,29,25,59,96,67} representing the given array, and input2 
=11 representing the number of elements in the array, then the expected output is 203, which is 
the sum of all prime numbers in this array except the largest prime number 67.
Explanation: The prime numbers in this array are 41, 43,31,29,59 and 67. The largest_prime 
number in this array is 67. So, let us leave out 67 and add all the other prime numbers to get the 
output.

Therefore, output=41+43+31+29+59=203.
